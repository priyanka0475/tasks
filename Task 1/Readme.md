This Bash script checks if Docker and Docker Compose are installed on the system or in virtual machine in cloud and installs them if they are missing.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the `docker_docker-compose_install.sh` script.

3. Make the script executable by running the following command:

   chmod 777 docker_docker-compose_install.sh
